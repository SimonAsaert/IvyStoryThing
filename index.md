## Story

### Never Could Miasma Make This

The birth of one like Poor Thing. For it is said they were not born but just some day just came to be in the world. Similar in ways to the Miasma of the world causing pain and illness, the universe must balance out and produce a creature pure and joyful as Poor Thing. The debt of nature being paid off in one stroke before it resumes its natural order.

And thus, Poor Thing was created fully formed. Normally, such an event would be surrounded by the [Healers of Geurstone](Factions.md#healers-of-geurstone), as they have kept the customs running for millennia. However, this time they didn't find the ritual in time, or were too early. It is hard to say as the Druids have kept their customs and themselves away from most civilization for their existence.

Poor Thing instead had to figure a way through this world unfocused and unguided.
