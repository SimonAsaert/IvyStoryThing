> ### Notes
>
>> **Type**: Shepherd Druids
>>
>> **Location**: Under the forests
>>
>> **Motto**: Nature's Scent Harms and Heals

### Beliefs

Following Nature's scents, it will reveal its secrets to us.

We must protect the events of nature's rituals, lest others disturb the balance

### Goals

Track the movement of nature, and keep them protected.

Keep the circle quiet, to keep our secrets away.

Listen to the advice of the Fey, they may be tricksters but they're more attuned to the natural order.
